## Enterprise Edition Guide

The Enterprise Edition of Metabase provides added functionality and solutions for large organizations looking to scale Metabase. This guide will walk you through the extra features in this edition of Metabase:

* [Sandboxing data based on user attributes](data-sandboxes.md)
* [Customizing how Metabase looks with white labeling](whitelabeling.md)
* [Authenticating with SAML](authenticating-with-saml.md)
* [Authenticating with JWT](authenticating-with-jwt.md)
* [Customizing drill-through for charts and tables](customizing-drill-through.md)

First things first, you'll need to install Metabase. If you haven’t done that yet, our [Installation Guide](../operations-guide/start.html#installing-and-running-metabase) will help you through the process.

Already done with that? Then let’s start by going over how to [connect Metabase to your database](01-managing-databases.md).
